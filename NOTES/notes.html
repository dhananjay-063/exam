<!-- Introduction to HTML: -->

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is used for creating web pages and web applications.
Hyper Textis "text within text." It's text that has a link in it.
When you click on a link that takes you to a new webpage.

<!-- • Hyper Text: -->
 connects two or more webpages (HTML documents) together.
 
<!-- Markup language:  -->
is a computer language used to format and arrange text in a document.

It makes text more interactive and dynamic.
With markup language, you can turn text into images, tables, links, and more.

Hence, HTML is a markup language used to create attractive web pages with styling that looks good in a web browser. An HTML document is made up of 
many HTML tags, each containing different content.

Block, Inline, and Inline Block

Block Elements : 
<!-- 
<h1> <h6>: Headings of different sizes.

    <div>: A container to group content.
    
    <hr>: A horizontal line to separate content.
    
    <li>: A list item.
    
    <ul>: An unordered (bulleted) list.
    
    <ol>: An ordered (numbered) list.
    
    <p>: A paragraph of text.
    
    <table>: A table for organizing data. 
-->
    
 Semantic Block Elements:

        <!--
       <header>: Contains introductory content like logos or navigation menus.
        
        <nav>: Contains navigation links.
        
        <footer>: Contains information like contact details or copyright.
        
        <main>: The main content of the page.
        
        <section> Defines a section of content.
        
        <article>: Represents an independent piece of content, such as a blog post
        
        <aside>: Contains content related to the main content, like a sidebar.   
            
-->


Inline Elements :
• Examples:

<!--
<a>: Creates hyperlinks.

<br>: Inserts a line break.

<script>: Includes JavaScript code.

<input>: Collects user input in forms.

<img>: Displays images.

<span>: A generic container that does not affect layout.

<b>: Makes text bold.

<label>: Labels form controls.

  <!-- Introduction to CSS: -->  
  
  Introduction to CSS:
  
  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
  It is a stylesheet language used to describe the style (look and formatting) of a document.
  CSS is used to control the layout of web pages, including elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, and the positioning of various components on the page. Advantage of CSS is it allows developer to separate contents from design.
  
  <!-- Basic format/style rule of CSS: -->
  
  A CSS rule has two main parts: Selector and Declaration block.
  
  <!-- Selector: -->
  
  The selector determines which HTML elements the style rule will apply to. It can target elements by their type, class, ID, attribute, etc.
  
  <!-- Declaration Block: -->
  
  The declaration block contains one or more declarations enclosed in curly braces []. Each declaration consists of a property and a value separated by a colori:".



  <!-- Types/ways to insert CSS -->

1. Inline CSS

Inline CSS involves applying styles directly within an HTML element's using style attribute.
<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
In inline CSS.Styles cannot be reused across multiple elements, less efficient for larger project.

2. Internal CSS

Internal CSS involves placing CSS rules within a <style> tag inside the <head> section of an HTML document, It is useful when you want to apply styles to a single document.

head

<style>

color: blue:

font-size: 18px;


</style

head

Internal CSS is only applicable to the specific HTML document, making it difficult to maintain and scale across multiple pages.

Introduction to Javascript :   */
JavaScript is a programming language that allows developers to create interactive web pages.    
JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.

/* use of javascript */
JavaScript is used to create interactive web applications and make web pages more dynamic. It can be used to update content, manage interactions,and improve the user experience. For example, JavaScript can be used to create menus, form validation, and animations.

/* What are variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them? */
/* answer:- */
Variables are containers for storing data values.

1)var: Globally or function-scoped, can be redeclared.
2)let: Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
3)const: Block-scoped, must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be reassigned.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
var x = 10;
let y = 20;
const z = 30;

/* What are the data types in JavaScript? */
/* Answer: */
JavaScript has two categories of data types:

Primitive types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol.
Non-primitive types: Object, Array, Function.

/* 
REACT */

/* What is React? */
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It is used for handling the view layer of the application and enables developers to create reusable Ul components.
/* Example: */
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

/* Why not to use Java script then? */
1. Writing complex java script code is very difficult
2. complex java script code may have error
3. complex java script code is difficult to maintain and edit

/* Features of React */
/* • Declarative:  */
React makes it easy to create interactive Uls. You design simple views for each state in your application, and React updates and renders the right components when your data changes.
/* • Component-Based:  */
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, and then compose them to make complex Uls.
• Learn Once, Write Anywhere: You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code


/* React Components */
A React application is made up of multiple comparients, each responsible for rendering a small, reusable piece of HTML, Components are like JavaScript functions but work in isolation and retum HTML via a render function.

/* Types of Components:- */
/* • Functional Components: */
 These are simple JavaScript functions that accept props and return React elements.

/* Class Components: */
 More complex, used when we need to use state and lifecycle methods.

/* Example of a Functional Component: */
function Welcome (props) ( return <h1>Hello, (props.name}!</h1>;

/* Example of a Class Component: */
class Welcome extends React.Component ( render() { return <h1>Hello, (this.props.name}</h1>; }


Here are some common React questions and their answers for an oral examination:

/* 1. What is React? */
Answer:
 React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of applications.

/* 2. What are the key features of React? */
Answer:
Virtual DOM: Optimizes rendering by updating only the necessary parts of the actual DOM.
Component-Based Architecture: UI is divided into reusable components.
One-Way Data Binding: Data flows in one direction, from parent to child.
JSX: Syntax extension that allows mixing HTML with JavaScript.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Makes the data predictable.

/* 3. What is JSX? */
Answer: 
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript files. It makes the code easier to understand and debug.

/* Angular JS */

/* 1. What is AngularJS? */
Answer: AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source framework developed by Google for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs). It extends HTML with additional attributes and makes it more interactive.

/* 2. What are the key features of AngularJS? */
Answer:
Two-Way Data Binding: Synchronizes data between the model and the view.

Dependency Injection: 
Allows components to depend on external services or modules.

Directives: 
Extends HTML with custom attributes and elements.

MVC Architecture: Separates application logic (Model), user interface (View), and control logic (Controller).
Filters: Formats data displayed in the view.

/* 3. What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular? */
Answer:
Aspect	AngularJS (1.x)	Angular (2+)
Language	JavaScript	TypeScript
Architecture	MVC	Component-based
Mobile Support	Limited	Designed for mobile
Performance	Comparatively slower	Faster, uses Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation

/* 4. What is Two-Way Data Binding? */
Answer: Two-way data binding in AngularJS synchronizes the data between the model (JavaScript object) and the view (HTML). When the model changes, the view reflects those changes automatically, and vice versa.
Example:

html
Copy code
<input type="text" ng-model="name">
<p>Hello, {{ name }}!</p>

/* 5. What are Directives in AngularJS? */
Answer: Directives are markers on DOM elements (like attributes, tags, or comments) that tell AngularJS to attach specific behaviors or transform the DOM element.
Common Directives: - ng-model: Binds data to input fields. - ng-bind: Replaces inner text with the model's value. - ng-repeat: Loops through data collections.

/* 6. What is the role of $scope in AngularJS? */
Answer: $scope is an object that acts as a bridge between the controller and the view. It allows data and functions defined in the controller to be accessed in the view.

/* 7. What are Filters in AngularJS? */
Answer: Filters are used to format data displayed to the user. They can be applied to expressions in the view.
Common Filters: - currency: Formats a number as currency. - uppercase: Converts text to uppercase. - filter: Filters a list based on a condition.

Example:

html
Copy code
<p>{{ price | currency }}</p>
8. What is a Controller in AngularJS?
Answer: A controller is a JavaScript function that manages the data and logic of a specific part of the application. It is attached to the view via the $scope object.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
app.controller('MyController', function($scope) {
    $scope.message = "Hello, AngularJS!";
});

/* 9. What is a Service in AngularJS? */
Answer: Services in AngularJS are reusable objects or functions that perform specific tasks, such as fetching data from an API. They follow the Singleton pattern.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
app.service('MyService', function() {
    this.sayHello = function() {
        return "Hello, Service!";
    };
});

/* 10. What is Dependency Injection in AngularJS? */
Answer: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in AngularJS to inject services, factories, or other components into controllers or other components. It makes the code modular and testable.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
app.controller('MyController', function($scope, MyService) {
    $scope.message = MyService.sayHello();
});
/* 
11. What is the $http Service in AngularJS? */
Answer: $http is an AngularJS service used to make AJAX requests to retrieve or send data to a server.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
app.controller('MyController', function($scope, $http) {
    $http.get('/api/data').then(function(response) {
        $scope.data = response.data;
    });
});

/* 12. What are Modules in AngularJS? */
Answer: Modules are containers for an application’s different parts like controllers, services, directives, etc. Every AngularJS application starts with a root module, often created using angular.module.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
var app = angular.module('MyApp', []);

/* 13. What is $digest in AngularJS? */
Answer: $digest is a process in AngularJS where all the watchers are checked to detect changes in the model. If a change is detected, the DOM is updated accordingly.

/* 14. What is $watch in AngularJS? */
Answer: $watch is a method used to observe changes in a variable or expression. It triggers a function when the observed value changes.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
$scope.$watch('name', function(newValue, oldValue) {
    console.log('Name changed from', oldValue, 'to', newValue);
});

/* 15. What is $routeProvider in AngularJS? */
Answer: $routeProvider is used to configure routes in AngularJS applications. It allows navigation between different views.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
app.config(function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider
        .when('/home', {
            templateUrl: 'home.html',
            controller: 'HomeController'
        })
        .when('/about', {
            templateUrl: 'about.html',
            controller: 'AboutController'
        });
});

/* 16. What are Single Page Applications (SPAs)? */
Answer: SPAs are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts, without reloading the entire page.
